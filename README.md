# Home Collection
Here I'm going to collect all the scripts I use

 - how_many_words - tool to count words in a piece of text found in MacOS clipboard
 - hidden - tool to quickly hide/show hidden files in MacOS
 - bufferguard - quick shotgun approach to avoid Apple Books putting copyright footer into every copied piece of text
 - filedozer - creates a broken copy of the file provided
